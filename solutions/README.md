## üìñ Description
"Leetcode in Python" is a series where I explain all solutions to popular leetcode problems. Each video contains a theoretical section (where I explain the reasoning behind the most optimal solution) and a practical section (where I go over the Python solution). Solving these leetcode problems has helped me land interviews and job offers from numerous companies like (Amazon - SWE offer, Goldman Sachs - SWE offer, Google - Onsite). This series is aimed to help anyone who is trying to crack their technical coding interviews!

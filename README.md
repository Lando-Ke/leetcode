# üêç Leetcode Solutions in Python

## üìñ Description
Hello everyone! **"Leetcode in Python"** is a **[YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pypLtNT8aNY&list=PLTJ_bWjv6i7xuOoib_cLLEbkH0EeweLej)** where I explain all solutions to *popular* leetcode problems. Each video contains a **theoretical section** (where I explain the reasoning behind the most optimal solution) and a **practical section** (where I go over the Python solution). Solving these leetcode problems has helped me land interviews and job offers from numerous companies like **Amazon** (*SWE offer*), **Goldman Sachs** (*SWE offer*), and **Google** (*onsite + one colossal failure*). Stay tuned to learn how to crack (nearly) any coding interview!

**TL;DR: Leetcode in Python will be the one resource you need to get into FAANG; system design not included!**

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è What's in this repo?

This repo contains the **coded solutions** (and any **supplementary material**) to my **["Leetcode in Python" YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pypLtNT8aNY&list=PLTJ_bWjv6i7xuOoib_cLLEbkH0EeweLej)**. Check it out if you tryna dive deep into the realm of computer science. Some aspects of this repo may be elusive unless you watch the corresponding video - keep that in mind as you traverse through this **[python solutions archive](https://github.com/TeluguGameboy/leetcode/tree/master/solutions)**.
